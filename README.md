Possibility Rule-based Classifier using Function Approximation (PRBF)

Language: Java

This algorithm is built using the XCSF (accuracy-based classifier system for function approximation) and can be used to train a model based on a dataset labeled by possibilistic (uncertain) labels. For more detailed information please refer to th efollowing resources.
